# A PlasTeX plugin for the Gerby project

## History

The previous gerby-plastex project was originally forked from plastex, and
the Gerby Renderer was added.

We have reversed this by taking a copy of the Gerby Renderer from the
gerby-plastex project (at commit e1a75188b29af756f64729d1a7966a4595d8d271
on 20/11/23 19:33:03) and making it into a functional PlasTeX plugin.
